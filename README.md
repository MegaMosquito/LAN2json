# LAN2json

This module provides a class with 2 static methods:
  `portscan`: finds TCP ports that have bound listeners on a specific host
  `scan`: requires root privilege and finds IPv4 and MAC addresses on a LAN

See the [LAN2json documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MegaMosquito/rfc1340/master/LAN2json.html) for more info.

Note that to use the `portscan` function requires this module too:
