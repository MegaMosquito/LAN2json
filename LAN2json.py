LAN2json.py LAN scanning tools that return JSON

This class provides a "scan()" function to perform Local Area Network (LAN)
scans using the popular "nmap" utility. Note that "nmap" must be run as root
in order to acquire this data (so your program may need to run as root).
The "nmap" utility will run as non-root but it will not give the required
MAC address data unless it has root privilege:

With root privilege nmap gives the MAC address and the manufacturer string:
 $ sudo nmap -sn -T5 192.168.123.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-06-01 14:07 PDT
Nmap scan report for 192.168.123.1
Host is up (0.0031s latency).
MAC Address: 3C:37:86:5E:EC:37 (Unknown)
Nmap scan report for 192.168.123.4
Host is up (0.0035s latency).
MAC Address: B8:27:EB:AC:14:3E (Raspberry Pi Foundation)
Nmap scan report for atomicpi.lan (192.168.123.163)
Host is up (0.015s latency).
MAC Address: 00:07:32:4B:E3:C6 (Aaeon Technology)
...

Without root privilege nmap gives only IP address and latency:
 $ nmap -sn -T5 192.168.123.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-06-01 14:07 PDT
Nmap scan report for 192.168.123.1
Host is up (0.0018s latency).
Nmap scan report for 192.168.123.4
Host is up (0.0064s latency).

This class also provides a "portscan" static method that performs a
sequential TCP port connection scan on a specified host (to discover all
of the TCP ports within a specified range on that host that have bound
and responsive "listener" processes).

There is also asmall main program wrapper so you can use it from the CLI.

Example CLI commands:
  $ sudo python LAN2json.py scan '192.168.123.0/24' '192.168.123.3' 'B8:27:EB:81:F4:79' '(Network Monitor Host)'
  $ sudo python LAN2json.py portscan '192.168.123.3' 1 65535

Static functions provided:
  portscan: find open TCP ports on a specific host
  scan: find IP and MAC addresses on the LAN

Attributes defined:
  TCP_PORT_MIN: The lowest usable TCP port (1, since 0 is "reserved")
  TCP_PORT_WELL_KNOWN_MAX: The highest numbered well-known TCP port
  TCP_PORT_REGISTERED_MIN: The lowest numbered registered TCP port
  TCP_PORT_REGISTERED_MAX: The highest numbered registered TCP port
  TCP_PORT_MAX: The highest possible TCP port number

    scan: synchronously run "nmap" in a subprocess to collect LAN hosts

    Use this function to scan the local area network (LAN) to detect LAN host
    IPv4 addresses, MAC addresses, and comment strings (as scanned from the
    network). The underlying nmap utility needs the subnet CIDR, so that is
    the first argument to this function.

    This function also takes arguments of the IP address, MAC address
    (and optionally a comment string) for the host where the command is
    being run. This is because nmap only returns the IP address for the
    local host. So providing these additional details enables the "scan"
    function to return a complete record even for the scanning host that
    is running the command.

    Args:
      subnet_cidr: string (subnet in CIDR format for this LAN)
      this_ip: string (the IPv4 address of this scanning host on the LAN)
      this_MAC: string (the MAC address of this scanning host)
      this_comment: string (optional comment field for this scanning host)

    Returns:
      a JSON array of records for each host discovered on the LAN.
      Fields and types for each record in the arry:
        "ip": string (IPv4 address where this host was found)
        "mac": string (colon-delimited MAC address of this host)

    portscan: synchronously scan for open TCP ports within a range

    Use this function to discover open TCP ports (i.e., those with listeners)
    within a specific range on a specified host. Since this scanning can be
    very slow, you may optionally specify a range of port numbers to scan.
    For example you might want to scan all of the well "known-port" numbers
    in range {1..1023}. On most hosts you require root privileges to
    bind a listener to these ports. Alternatively you could choose the
    IANA registered port range {1..49151} (i.e., from 2^10 to 2^14 + 2^15 âˆ’ 1)
    but this larger range will take much longer to scan. If you can spare
    the time, you could also scan all possible TCP port numbers {0..65535}.
    
    If no range is specified, the default range of {1..1023} is used.

    This function is aware of the TCP port assignments in RFC1340, available
    at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1340 and it will supply the "keyword"
    and "description" fields for thos ports that are provided in RFC1340,
    if any, for all open ports it discovers.

    Args:
      ip: string (IPv4 address of this host on the LAN)
      min: integer (optional lowest port nuber to scan -- default TCP_PORT_MIN)
      max: integer (optional highest port number to scan -- default TCP_PORT_WELL_KNOWN_MAX)

    Returns:
      a JSON array of records for each TCP ports with an active listener.
      Fields and types for each record in the array:
        "port": integer (the port number where a bound listener was found)
